## Monitor and Analyze Network Traffic
    In this practice lab, 
    - you will set up VPC Flowlogs, query the VPC Flowlogs by using Amazon CloudWatch log insights, review Amazon CloudWatch metrics and create an alarm and dashboard for increased visibility. - - Create an Amazon S&S topic to notify administrators when network traffic exceeds a specific threshold. 
    - CloudWatch is used to monitor your AWS resource and the applications you run on AWS in real-time. 
    - Retention settings can be used to specify how long log events are kept in cloudwatch logs. - - Expired log events get deleted automatically. Just like metric filters, retention settings are also assigned to log groups and the retention assigned to your log group is applied to their log streams. 
    - Be aware that setting this to never expire can increase your log storage cost. 
    
    - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC} provisions a logically isolated section of AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you have defined. 
    - VPC Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your PPC. 
    
    - Session Manager is a fully managed AWS system manager capability. With Session Manager, you can manage your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon EC2 instances, edge devices, on-premise servers, and virtual web machines. Session Manager allows you to specify the amount of time to allow your user to be inactive before the system ends the session. 
    
    - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides a resizable  computing capacity to build and host your software systems. 
    
    - IPerf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. It suppels tuning of various parameters related to timing buffers and protocols. TCP, UDP, SCDP with IP version 4 and IP version 6. For each test, it reports the bandwidth laws and other parameters.
