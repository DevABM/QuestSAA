## Populating the data catalog. 
In this practice lab, you will
- use AWS Glue to create database in the data catalog. 
- Use an AWS Glue crawler to create a table in the data catalog. 
- Use Amazon Athena to query data in the table. 
- Run the inventory management application to ingest new inventory data with added columns. 
- Run the crawler again and perform an Athena query to check the new table.
