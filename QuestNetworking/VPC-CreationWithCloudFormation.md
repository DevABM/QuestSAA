## Creating an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud(VPC) with CloudFormation

## AWS CLOUDFORMATION
Aws CloudFormation gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion.

One can use AWS CloudFormation's sample templates or create own templates to describe the AWS resources, and any associated dependencies or runtime parameters, required to run your application. No need to figure out the order for provisioning AWS services or the subtleties of making those dependencies work.

One can deploy and update a template and its associated collection of resources (called stack) by using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface(CLI), or APIs. CloudFormation is available at no additional charge, and you pay only for the AWS resources needed to run your applications.

## AMAZON VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD (VPC)

<b>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)</b> lets to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where one can launch resources within a virtual network. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.


You can easily customize the network configuration for your virtual private cloud(VPC). For example, you can create a <b> public-facing subnet </b> for your web servers that has access to the internet and place your backend systems such as database or application servers in a <b> private-facing subnet </b> with no internet access. you van leverage multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists, to help control access to Amazon EC2 instances in each subnet.
